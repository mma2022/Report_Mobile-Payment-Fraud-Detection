# Report-Mobile-Payment-Fraud-Detection

In this project, we applied logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost on simulated transaction data in order to improve the dummy clientâ€™s ability to detect fraudulent transactions. All three models yield high accuracy in detecting fraud payment. We considered logistic regression as the best model for the simulated data given its lower time cost. Real-world transaction data are required to improve model performance and choose the best algorithm.
